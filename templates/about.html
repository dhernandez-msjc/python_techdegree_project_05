            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>
                I am a clinical therapist (Associate Clinical Social Worker) by day, Associate Professor in
                Computer Science other times, and amateur developer by night.  I have a passion for learning
                and teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working on my clinical hours towards LCSW licensure, continuing to practice
                programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java in order to find ways to teach students
                fun ways to learn the craft.
